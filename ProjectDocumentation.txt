Survey User Page:

    Functional Elements: Front End
        Answers to questions will not trigger any behavior until the "Continue" button is pressed on the page.
        Continue button: Will trigger the following methods:
        
            void onSubmitButtonClicked(){
                if(passOrFail()){
                    sessionStorage.setItem(sql, buildSQL());
                    sessionStorage.setItem(advancementLevel, currentAdvancementLevel);
                    redirect to next page
                }
                else{
                    submit data to database (<-- not sure how this will work) and go to resources page
                    https://csdss.ewu.edu/take-survey/?level=<whatever_the_level_is>
                }
            }
        
            boolean passOrFail(){
                returns true if the user can advance to the next level
                returns false if the user cannot
            }
            
            String buildSQL(){
                returns an SQL string that when run can log all responses in the database
            }
            
    Functional elements: Back End
        Basically outlined in Andy's previous project. There will be one tiny bit more complex in that there will have to be a PIN check to make sure the right survey is being pulled, but other than that, little difference.


Survey User Page : Resources Landing Page

    php will take the key/value pair in the url (seen above) and use that to determine what to render on screen
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admin Dashboard

No scripts needed on the landing page. Simply 3 <href> links (with fancy css and stuff) to the 3 parts of the dashboard:

3 parts of the dashboard are: New Survey, Modify Survey, View Results

UNLESS: 
MasterPage:
    Mainly just for the header if we have a Notifications bell. Pretty sure Notifications can just be HTML and CSS, but there may be some scripting involved with querying the DB for notifications.
    

    
Admin Dashboard : New Survey Page

~ loadSurvey(ID)
    - called on initial page load by php
    - either loads existing survey or a blank new survey depending on if ID exists or not
        if ID exists, queries DB for everything and populates page with it
        else, creates entry for new survey in DB but marks it as "incomplete"
    - creates and saves the ID of the new survey on creation so that subsequent functions can find the right ID in the DB

~ newQuestion()
    - loads a bootstrap modal for creating a new question
    - called when the "Add Question" button is clicked
    
~ addSeparator()
    - called when the "Add New Advancement Level" button is clicked
    - adds a new separator to the survey, which will, on the user side, be a new page with a "Continue" button before it. This is also a new advancement level.
    
~ saveSurvey()
    - called when clicking "Save" button
    - marks survey (by previously saved ID) as "complete" in DB
    - presents bootstrap modal w/ "your survey is saved" <href>Go back to Dashboard?</href>
    
~ cancelSurvey()
    - called when clicking "close without saving"
    - checks survey by ID in DB
        if survey is marked as "incomplete", deletes it in DB
    - presents bootstram modal with "Survey Cancelled" <href>Go back to Dashboard?</href>
    
~ deleteQuestion()
    - deletes question by ID from DB
    - called on clicking "Delete Question" button //This Button is dynamically created
    - un-presents question from page
    
~ modifyQuestion()
    - opens bootstrap modal to modify question
    - called on clicking "Modify Question" button //This button is dynamically created
    - populates modal with current values as queried from database
    
Admin Dashboard : New Survey Page : Question Modal

~ selectQuestionType()
    - called when an item is selected from the "type" dropdown menu
    - populates the modal with items based on the type selected
        if "checkmark" is selected, call newCheckmarkQuestion()
        if "radio" is selected, call newRadioQuestion()
        if "long form" is selected, call newLongFormQuestion()
        if "true/false" is selected, call newTrueFalseQuestion()
        if "scale" is selected, call newScaleQuestion()

~ newCheckMarkQuestion()
    - called by selectQuestionType()
    - creates an "Add Item" button and other things in the modal
    
~ newRadioQuestion()
    - called by selectQuestionType()
    - creates an "Add Item" button and other things in the modal
    
~ newLongFormQuestion()
    - called by selectQuestionType()

~ newTrueFalseQuestion()
    - called by selectQuestionType()

~ newScaleQuestion()
    - called by selectQuestionType()

~ onSaveQuestionButtonClicked()
    - called on clicking "Save" button
    - calls checkQuestionCompleteness()

~ checkQuestionCompleteness()
    - checks to make sure question is completed
        if it is, call saveQuestion()
        else, display error message

~ saveQuestion()
    - called by checkQuestionCompleteness()
    - creates Question ID and question in database based on info entered by admin in modal
    - creates element in main page for question, "Modify Question" button, "Delete Question" button
    - closes Modal
    
~ addCheckmark()
    - called by addItem()
    - creates element in Modal for Admin to add checkmark option to the question
    
~ addRadioButton()
    - called by addItem()
    - creates element in Modal for Admin to add radio optino to the question
    
~ addItem()
    - called by clicking "Add Item" in modal //This button is dynamically created
    - checks "type" dropdown menu
        if "checkmark" is selected, call addCheckmark()
        if "radio" is selected, call addRadioButton()
        
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admin Dashboard : Modify Survey Page

Mostly HTML and CSS with fancy links to "New Survey Page"

~ loadSurveys()
    - called on page load
    - queries database for existing surveys and loads them on the page

When clicked, these links give the ID of the survey to modify through the "New Survey Page", except it redirects with key/value pairs in the url, so when the page loads and php calls the loadSurvey(ID) function, it passes the ID and the page loads an existing survey instead of a blank one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admin Dashboard : View Results

There's got to be some existing Data Analytics Framework that we can use here for visualization and stuff

IDK...

Something like this? : https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/data-visualization-with/9781491920565/ch04.html

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems to address:

1) dynamic controls loading

2) data Visualization (Chart.js)?

3) View Results: intuitive organization, etc.

4) Generic, generic, generic

5) Maybe an initial tutorial for new admins??????
