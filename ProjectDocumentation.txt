Survey User Page : Resources Landing Page

    php will take the key/value pair in the url (seen above) and use that to determine what to render on screen
    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admin Dashboard

No scripts needed on the landing page. Simply 3 <href> links (with fancy css and stuff) to the 3 parts of the dashboard:

3 parts of the dashboard are: New Survey, Modify Survey, View Results

UNLESS: 
MasterPage:
    Mainly just for the header if we have a Notifications bell. Pretty sure Notifications can just be HTML and CSS, but there may be some scripting involved with querying the DB for notifications.

Admin Dashboard : Modify Survey Page

Mostly HTML and CSS with fancy links to "New Survey Page"

~ loadSurveys()
    - called on page load
    - queries database for existing surveys and loads them on the page

When clicked, these links give the ID of the survey to modify through the "New Survey Page", except it redirects with key/value pairs in the url, so when the page loads and php calls the loadSurvey(ID) function, it passes the ID and the page loads an existing survey instead of a blank one.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Admin Dashboard : View Results

There's got to be some existing Data Analytics Framework that we can use here for visualization and stuff

IDK...

Something like this? : https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/data-visualization-with/9781491920565/ch04.html

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problems to address:

1) Session Management

2) dynamic database queries

3) dynamic controls loading

4) data Visualization

5) View Results: intuitive organization, etc.
